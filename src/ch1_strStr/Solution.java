/*
 * For a given source string and a target string, you should output the first index(from 0) of target string in source string.

If target does not exist in source, just return -1.

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Clarification
Do I need to implement KMP Algorithm in a real interview?

Not necessary. When you meet this problem in a real interview, the interviewer may just want to test your basic implementation ability. But make sure you confirm with the interviewer first.
Example
If source = "source" and target = "target", return -1.

If source = "abcdabcdefg" and target = "bcd", return 1.
